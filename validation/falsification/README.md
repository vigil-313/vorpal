# Falsification

Criteria for disproving or revising the framework.

## Core Claims to Test

1. **Anti-sycophancy prompts change model behavior**
   - Falsified if: Prompts produce no measurable difference in outputs

2. **Changed behavior improves outcomes**
   - Falsified if: Users with prompts get worse results than without

3. **Domain-specific prompts outperform generic prompts**
   - Falsified if: A single generic prompt works equally well across all domains

4. **The framework is not just inverted sycophancy**
   - Falsified if: Prompts produce reflexive negativity rather than calibrated accuracy

## Revision Triggers

Conditions under which specific prompts or principles should be revised or removed.
