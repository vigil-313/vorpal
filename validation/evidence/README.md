# Evidence

Test results, transcripts, and before/after comparisons demonstrating prompt effects.

## Structure

Each piece of evidence should include:
- **Context:** Which prompt, which model, what task
- **Without prompt:** Baseline behavior
- **With prompt:** Changed behavior
- **Assessment:** What changed, whether it's an improvement
